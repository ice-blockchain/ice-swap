# CryptoAudit.report â€“ Remediation Audit Report for `IONBridgeRouter` and `IONSwap`

**Project Name**: IONBridgeRouter and IONSwap

**Remediation Audit Date**: 2023.10.31

**Document Version**: 1.2

---

## Introduction

This report presents the findings of the remediation audit for the **IONBridgeRouter** and **IONSwap** smart contracts, following the initial audit conducted on 2025.01.17 (version 1.1). The purpose of this remediation audit is to verify that the issues identified in the initial audit have been adequately addressed and to ensure that the contracts are secure for deployment.

---

## Scope

The scope of this remediation audit includes:

- **IONBridgeRouter.sol**
- **IONSwap.sol**

**Files in Scope**:

- `/contracts/ion-bridge-router/IONBridgeRouter.sol`
- `/contracts/swap/IONSwap.sol`

---

## Executive Summary

After a thorough review of the updated smart contracts, we confirm that all issues identified in the initial audit (v1.1) have been addressed appropriately. The contracts now adhere to best practices in Solidity programming and exhibit improved security and robustness.

**Summary of Findings:**

- **Critical Severity**: 0 remaining issues
- **Major Severity**: 0 remaining issues
- **Medium Severity**: 0 remaining issues
- **Low Severity**: 0 remaining issues
- **Informational**: 0 remaining issues

The contracts are considered secure for deployment.

## Remediation Verification

### IONBridgeRouter Contract

#### Medium Severity Issues

**M01: Missing Reentrancy Guards on Sensitive Functions**

- **Initial Finding**: The `burn` and `voteForMinting` functions lacked reentrancy guards.
- **Remediation**:
    - The `IONBridgeRouter` contract now inherits from `ReentrancyGuard`.
    - The `nonReentrant` modifier has been applied to the `burn` and `voteForMinting` functions.

**Verification**: The issue has been resolved. The `burn` and `voteForMinting` functions are now protected against reentrancy attacks.

---

#### Low Severity Issues

**L01: Lack of Input Validation for External Contract Addresses**

- **Initial Finding**: Constructor did not validate the addresses of the external contracts.
- **Remediation**:
    - Added `require` statements in the constructor to ensure that `_iceV1`, `_iceV2`, `_bridge`, and `_ionSwap` are not zero addresses.
    - Provided descriptive error messages for each check.

**Verification**: Input validation is now implemented in the constructor, preventing deployment with invalid addresses.

---

**L02: Missing Events for Critical State-Changing Functions**

- **Initial Finding**: The `burn` and `voteForMinting` functions did not emit events upon successful execution.
- **Remediation**:
    - Defined new events `TokensBurned` and `TokensMinted`.
    - Emitted these events in the `burn` and `voteForMinting` functions upon successful execution.

**Verification**: Events are now properly emitted, enhancing transparency and facilitating off-chain monitoring and auditing.

---

#### Informational Findings

**I01: Use of Deprecated `approve` Function Pattern**

- **Initial Finding**: Use of `approve` without considering potential race conditions.
- **Remediation**:
    - Replaced direct calls to `approve` with `SafeERC20`'s `forceApprove` function in `_swapIceV1ToV2` and `_swapIceV2ToV1`.

**Verification**: The `forceApprove` function is now used, mitigating risks associated with the deprecated `approve` pattern.

---

**I02: Missing Error Messages on `require` Statements**

- **Initial Finding**: Generic error messages were used in `require` statements.
- **Remediation**:
    - Defined custom errors `InvalidAmount()` and `UnauthorizedReceiver()`.
    - Replaced `require` statements with `if` conditions that `revert` with custom errors.

**Verification**: Custom errors are now used, improving gas efficiency and providing clearer error messages for better debugging.

---

**I03: Function Visibility Could Be Optimized**

- **Initial Finding**: Internal functions could be marked as private.
- **Remediation**:
    - Changed the visibility of `_swapIceV1ToV2` and `_swapIceV2ToV1` from `internal` to `private`.

**Verification**: Function visibility is optimized, potentially saving gas costs by preventing unnecessary function slots.

---

### IONSwap Contract

#### Low Severity Issues

**L01: Potential Precision Loss in Token Exchange Calculations**

- **Initial Finding**: Possible precision loss due to integer division.
- **Remediation Decision**: The team decided not to fix this issue because the precision loss would only affect extremely minor amounts, which are not relevant for the tokenomics.

**Verification**: Acknowledged by the team; the decision is acceptable given the negligible impact on the contract's functionality and user experience.

---

#### Informational Findings

**I01: Optimize Function Visibility**

- **Initial Finding**: Functions `getPooledAmountOut` and `getOtherAmountOut` were declared `public` but could be `external`.
- **Remediation**:
    - Changed the visibility of `getPooledAmountOut` and `getOtherAmountOut` from `public` to `external`.

**Verification**: Function visibility is optimized, saving gas costs when called externally.

---

**I02: Add Zero Address Check for `_receiver` in `withdrawLiquidity`**

- **Initial Finding**: The `_receiver` parameter was not validated against the zero address.
- **Remediation**:
    - Added a check to ensure `_receiver` is not the zero address.
    - Defined a custom error `InvalidReceiverAddress()`.

**Verification**: The zero address check is now implemented, preventing potential issues with token transfers to the zero address.

---

**I03: Use Descriptive Custom Errors in Constructor Validations**

- **Initial Finding**: Constructor validations used custom errors without clear messages.
- **Remediation**:
    - Defined specific custom errors `InvalidPooledTokenAddress()` and `InvalidOtherTokenAddress()`.
    - Used these custom errors in constructor validations to provide clearer messages.

**Verification**: Custom errors now provide clear and specific messages, enhancing readability and debugging.

---

## Code Review Summary

The updated contracts have been thoroughly reviewed, and the changes align with the recommendations provided in the initial audit. The use of `ReentrancyGuard`, custom errors, event emissions, and safe approval patterns significantly enhance the security and maintainability of the contracts.

---

## Recommendations

No further recommendations are provided at this time, as all identified issues have been addressed. It is advisable to continue following best practices in smart contract development and to consider regular security audits, especially after any substantial code changes.

---

## Conclusion

All issues identified in the initial audit have been appropriately addressed. The **IONBridgeRouter** and **IONSwap** contracts now adhere to best practices and exhibit no known vulnerabilities. The contracts are considered secure for deployment to a production environment.

---

**Disclaimer**: This remediation audit does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. It is recommended to follow continuous security best practices and monitoring.
